<p><P>There are four major subsystems:
<ol type="1">
	<li>Modeling User Interface
	<li>Compiler
	<li>Enactment Mechanism, which we refer to as the PEOS (Process Enactment Operating System); the kernel is further decomposed into:
	
	<ol type="a">
		<li>Event handling mechanism.
		<li>Engine, comprising a virtual machine for executing PML models.
		<li>Repository, where process  state is stored.
	</ol>
	
	<li>Enactment User Interfaces 
</ol>
<h4>Modeling UI -- Compiler</h4>
	<p>The interface between the Modeling UI and Compiler is defined by the
PML Grammar, which is part of the PML compiler requirements.
<br>
<h4>Compiler -- PEOS</h4>
	<p>The interface between the Compiler and PEOS is defined by the process
Virtual Machine language.
<br>
<h4>Engine -- Repository</h4>
	<p>The interface between the Engine (virtual machine) and the repository
is determined by the needs of the virtual machine to set and query
process and product state.
<h4>PEOS -- Enactment UI</h4>
	<p>The interface between PEOS and the various enactment user interfaces
is determined by the various Agent interaction scenarios.  The following messages
are defined:
<ol type="1">
	<li>Create(model) - create a new instance of model
	<li>Query(query) - perform a query against the repository.
	<li>Query Available Tasks - request a list of tasks in the "ready" state that can be performed by the requesting agent.
	<li>Available Tasks - Reply to "Query Available Tasks".  A list of actions in the "ready" state that can be performed by the requesting agent.
	<li>Select Action(action) - the agent has elected to perform action, which should be marked "active."
	<li>Suspend Action(action> - the agent has temporarily stopped performing action; it should be marked "suspended."
	<li>Abort Action - the agent has permanently stopped performing action; it should be marked "aborted".
	<li>Action Done - the agent has completed action.
	<li>Status - reply to request messages that don't explicitly request results.
</ol>
