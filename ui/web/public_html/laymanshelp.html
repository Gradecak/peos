<p> PEOS (Process Enactment Operating System) is a process modeler. It is
a system set up to step a user through a given process.
<p> A process is a set of steps to achieve a certain result. For example
the
steps of a making a martini is a process. First we pour gin into a glass. Then we add vermouth, an olive, and then we shake or stir the mixture to produce a martini. 
<p>PEOS will take software process models and compile them into executable
code. the code is then executed by a virtual machine that computes process states in response to process events submitted by users through a variety of user interfaces, and advises them of pending tasks as they become available.
<p>A more realalistic example would occur as students submit the
milestones
throughout the semester where PEOS will assist in changing the appropriate documents and verifying that the correct steps were taken before the user is allowed to commit there changes.

componets  consult <a href="techhelp.html">the technical help page</a>.
