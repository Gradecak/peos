This documentation is for "test1".
Please read the "Readme" file.
There are three types of users who can authenticate:

user 1 is the power user.
user 2 is the system administrator.
user 3 is the general user.

Any other user is invalid.

LOGGING ON AT THE BROWSER:
    To log on to use the Web UI, enter any name in the username field and
    a password that is the same as the username with the number 1, 2, or 3
    appended to it. These numbers are used to simulate different kind of 
    users with different kind of allowable operations.
  (Example: A power user should type ---: username : user,password: user1) 

TESTING THE AUTHENTICATION SCRIPT:

      The "test1" file has a script to test the login.cgi for accurate 
      authentication.
      
Test script status: 

working.

Description of using the test cases.
     
      The script is successful in checking the 3 types of users and
       returns back the part of html documantation, which is pipped into a
      file called "test.tmp"  which gives the following output:

    USER1 AUTHENTICATION SUCCESSFUL  ---when user1 has been authenticated.
    USER2 AUTHENTICATION SUCCESSFUL  ---when user2 has been authenticated.
    USER3 AUTHENTICATION SUCCESSFUL  ---when user3 has been authenticated.
   
      Invalid authentication includes users other than the 3 users
      described above.      
      In case of invalid authentication, it returns back the part of 
      html documentation which includes:
 
               INVALID AUTHENTICATION
      "The user name and password failed to authenticate"
