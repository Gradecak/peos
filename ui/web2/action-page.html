<h1>action_name_here</h1>

<h2>Resources</h2>
<a href="resource-page.html"> RequiredResource</a> 
<a href="resource-page.html"> AnotherRequiredResource</a> 

<h2>Description</h2>
<p> The action's script field would be displayed here.  This should be
formatted as an html paragraph (&lt;p&gt;), rather than text; we allow
some html markup in the script field.

Depending on the action state,  buttons should be displayed:
<ol type="a">
<li>Active - display both ``Done'' (to <em>finish</em> the action),
and ``OK'' (to dismiss the page and redisplay the worklist).
<li>Suspended -  display both ``Perform'' (to make the action <em>active</em>),
and ``OK'' (to dismiss the page and redisplay the worklist).
<li>Ready - display both ``Perform'' (so set the action to
<em>active</em>) and ``OK'' (to dismiss the page and redisplay the worklist).
</ol>

<input type="submit" value="Done"> (or ``Perform'')
<input type="submit" value="OK"> (or ``Dismiss'' or ``Back''?)
</form>
