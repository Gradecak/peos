   <h1>PMLcheck Submit Form</h1>

   <p>This is a very minimal pmlcheck interface designed to demonstrate
   the round-trip process for submitting pml code to a server-side cgi
   program.  It simply sends the contents of the editor pane to the
   cgi program, then displays the output.</p>

   <p>Ideally, you would want to submit the form via jquery's ajax()
   method so the pmlcheck output can be captured and inserted into an
   field next to the editor pane so the ouput can be compared to the
   input.</p>

  <form METHOD=POST ACTION="check.cgi">
  <p> PML code to check: <textarea name="editedText" cols="80" value=""></textarea>
  <p> <input type="submit" name="op" value="submit"> 
  <input type=reset>
  </form>
