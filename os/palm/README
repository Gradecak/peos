Installation Instructions

-- To 'make' PalmPEOS from source --

You will need to install and set up the PRC-tools, latest PalmOS SDK and
PilRC on whatever machine you will be using.  These downloads are available 
for free from Palm's website at http://www.palmos.com/dev/tools/gcc/index.html

Installation and setup instructions are included on the site, and are
fairly straightforward.  

Once these tools are installed, you can simply 'cd' to the directory
containing the PalmPEOS source code, and type 'make' at the command
line.  The PRC-tools contain patches to gcc, etc., to make the
.c and .h files, and PilRC will then integrate the resource files
(i.e. the form/interface elements) into a Palm-executable file
called PalmPEOS.prc.

-- To run PalmPEOS --

To run the PalmOS application, you will need to either have a Palm-powered
device or install the Palm Emulator (POSE).  POSE is available at the prev-
iously-mentioned address: http://www.palmos.com/dev/tools/gcc/index.html.
Once again, installation and setup instructions are available on the site.

To install the application, simply select 'Install' on the Palm Desktop (if
you are using an actual device), or right-click and select "Install application/
database" if you are using POSE. Then select the file PalmPEOS.prc to install,
and click on its icon on the device/emulator after it's been installed.

To add model files, compile them from pml format to .txt using peos' compiler
(see peos/src/compiler/ for further instructions).  Once you have compiled the
model file to .txt format, simply run it through txt2PEOS (available in the
PalmPEOS source-code directory) by typing: "txt2PEOS -c desiredNameOnDevice modelName.txt 
modelName.pdb" at the command line.  To run properly, txt2PEOS must be in the PATH.
